Supply your username and password.  After starting the software,
type your blog entry and use control + D and then return to end. (EOF)

Alternatively, you may use a text file like this:
jjclient -u username -p password < myfile.txt

Other flags include -s for subject and -d for turning on debug messages

Compiling on MidnightBSD:

NOTE: if you want to use gmake, you need to specify CC as an env var as it defaults to
c99 which breaks.  e.g.  
env CC=gcc12 gmake

This client requires Gtk 3 and pkg-config to build along with
xmlrpc-c.
